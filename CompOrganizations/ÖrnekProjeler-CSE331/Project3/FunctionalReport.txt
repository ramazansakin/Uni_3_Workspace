CSE331 - Fall 2013 - Project3 - Functional Report File

Genreal Note:
	Not all possible cases are tested on files RegisterBlock32Bit.v and 
	Mem32Bit.v	but presented tests are works correctly.

Mem32Bit:
	sample mem file crated for 128 words and passed tests which are done in
	file named Mem32BitTest.v. Also has support for 512MB memory in code which
	is commented out. Uses mempory32.mem file as memry storage.

RegisterBlock32Bit:
	Register Block looks working properly by tests from RegisterBlock32BitTest.v
	file. Has write data, read data and reset all registers functions.
	making reset signal to 1 means fill all the registers with zero.
	Makes every change on positive edge of CLK input. So there must be shift 
	from 0 to 1 at CLK to apply changes to registers.

Other Notes:
	There are some muxes which designed to use in this project but later decided
	to they are not necessary. So they are still in project folder but not using
	in project.
